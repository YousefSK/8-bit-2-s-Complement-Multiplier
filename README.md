# Introduction

In this lab, we implemented an 8-bit 2’s complement binary multiplier that takes two 8-bit numbers and outputs a 16-bit number. Since it’s a 2’s complement multiplier, it’s capable of multiplying positive times positive, negative times positive, positive times negative, and negative times negative numbers, as well as consecutive multiplications. We implemented this multiplier through a series of additions and shifts, which are determined by specific signals such as M.
